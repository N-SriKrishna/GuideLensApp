# GuideLensApp
GuideLensApp is a Android application that provides AI-powered visual navigation. Using on-device machine learning models (YOLO World, DeepLabV3), it performs real-time object detection and floor segmentation. The app then uses A* pathfinding to calculate a safe route to a target object, guiding the user with AR overlays on the live camera feed.
